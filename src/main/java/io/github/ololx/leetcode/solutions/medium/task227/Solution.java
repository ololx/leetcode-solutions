/**
 * 227. Basic Calculator II
 *
 * Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.
 * The integer division should truncate toward zero.
 * You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231
 * - 1].
 * Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as
 * eval().
 *
 * Example 1:
 * <p>Input: s = "3+2*2"
 * Output: 7</p>
 *
 * Example 2:
 * <p>Input: s = " 3/2 "
 * Output: 1</p>
 *
 * Example 3:
 * <p>Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
 * Output: 5</p>
 *
 * Constraints:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         s represents a valid expression.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 - 1].
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
